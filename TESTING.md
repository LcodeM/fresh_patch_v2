## Responsiveness

Home page responds well when tested on different device sizes. 

Note when increasing display size, the burger menu responds and branches out into inline menu in navbar, once into desktop view, the items in the menu show a line underneath when hovering over each one. When increasing display size, section elements also grow larger and flex-direction changes from column to row, with content displaying differently for each size, ensuring readability. Buttons also become active on desktop with hover function changing background and text colour for user experience.

Seasonal Suggestions page also responds well, with the same elements changing as the displays grow larger and change flex-direction. Video displays well and plays in all sizes.

Subscribe page also responds well, with increase in display size altering the flex-direction of radio buttons and input elements from column to row, also adjusting the spacing and alignment of all items as the display grows larger. Button becomes interactive with hover feature on desktop display.
