## Introduction

Fresh Patch is a website about growing your own food and is aimed at supporting beginner gardeners on their first journey into growing vegetables, as well as providing daily top tips for gardeners of all levels. The website also aims to provide useful information for a year-round plan on how to plan, prepare and maintain a gardening space, as well as some insight into the different types of produce that can be grown at different times of year and seasons.

Users of this website will be able to gather the basic information needed to begin preparing and growing their own vegetables.

### Site Structure

Fresh Patch has 4 pages in total, 3 that are navigatable by the user through buttons or page links, and 1 via the correct submission of a form.

- 'Home' page: 
    The homepage is the main landing page for the website, where users will find a straight-to-the-point heading and brief introduction to the site, that aims to provide instant clarity and understanding of the content and what to expect.

    The opening content sections include imagery relevant to gardening, as well as bitesize informative text that will be immediately helpful. The final sections of the page include a 'Today's Top Tip' section (updated daily to provide new tips to all users) along with a video related to the topic, and a button link to the newsletter subscription form to entice users to sign up.

    All pages have a 'back to top' button to improve UX.

- 'Seasonal Suggestions' page:
    The second page, navigatable by the navigation bar (or burger menu on mobile), hosts information for users looking for tips on what to grow during different seasons. This information aims to provide users with useable content and knowledge, no matter when they are accessing the site, to give them hands-on ideas whenever they want them.

    Mirroring the home page, users can find the 'Today's Top Tip' and subscribe button sections at the bottom of the page.

- 'Subscribe' page:
    As the name suggests, the subscribe page is an easy-to-complete form-style submission section for users who are interested in staying up to date with more content and tips from the 'Fresh Patch' community.

- Response page: 
    The response page is designed to only be accessible once the form submission is complete - meaning there is no navigation within the site to this page without completing the form successfully. However, those aware of its existence can simply alter the URL and add "reponse.html" to access it. 

### Wireframes

Disclaimer: Please be aware that all links open in the same window, make sure to manually open in a new tab.

### Design

#### Colour Scheme

![Colour scheme](https://github.com/LcodeM/fresh_patch_v2/blob/main/documentation/Fresh%20Patch%20colour%20palette.png)

The colour scheme for this project was generated using [Coolors](https://coolors.co/), inspired by the London Image Institute (see Credits and Technologies sections of this file).

According to the London Image Institute, the colour green symbolises growth, fertility, survival and health - fitting to the subject of gardening as these are all things directly related to plants. The colour brown similarly is associated with resilience and the earth. Both of these colours also have a visual association with grass, soil and vegetables generally, making them a sure fit for this project. 

To ensure there was enough contrast to the website, green (#34482A) was used as the primary background, h1, logo and navbar menu items, with the 'platinum' (#E3E3E3) white as a background to the navbar and as a background colour to all elements displayed on top of the main background. Brown (#835937) was used as an accent colour on buttons and the footer for social links and content, to ensure that there was not too much variation throughout the page. 

#46583D was added and reserved for any future usage where necessary to have a slightly lighter shade of green.

Black was used as the primary body font colour to provide necessary contrast against the white section backgrounds.

#### Typogrophy / Fonts

The font family 'Ubuntu' was downloaded and used from Google Fonts, as it provides an easy-on-the-eye font that also draws some attention to the logo with its irregular curvature. This font was used for all text across the website.

#### Imagery

All images for the website were sourced from [Pexels](https://www.pexels.com/).

## Features

### Existing Features

#### Navigation

The 'navbar' is located at the very top of every single page, and contains information for the users including the name of the page and logo (which also navigates back to the Home page from all other pages for usability), a navigation menu of all accessible pages including; Home, Seasonal Suggestions, and Join (the subscribe.html page is labelled 'Join' in the nav menu in order to make it sound more appealing to the user, as it gives the impression that they are joining a community, not simply offering their information to a database). Each of which has a hover feature on laptop screens for user experience, as well as an 'active' feature, underlining the current page the user is on.

The navigation bar is:
- Clear and easy to see, with contrast against the main background and consistent in it's placement across all pages and screen sizes.
- Responsive to the layout of the page based on device, reducing the menu items down into a 'burger menu' for mobile, as to not take up too much space or not be visible.
- Inline with all other design elements and consistent with the branding.

- Mobile ![Mobile](https://github.com/LcodeM/fresh_patch_v2/blob/main/assets/images/Mobile%20Navbar.png)

The video is also respinsive across screen sizes for mobile, tablet laptop/desktop.

Call to action section offers a direct link to subcription form on 'Subscribe' page in order to capture user information and retain users in database, growing the community.

![Home](https://github.com/LcodeM/fresh_patch_v2/blob/main/assets/images/homepage-full-screencapture.png)

#### Seasonal Suggestions Page

All "seasons" sections (Winter, Spring, Summer, Autumn) offer informative tips to users that they can action throughout the year, as well as key information they can use as a 'reminder' when they enter a new season, or have new ideas for what they can grow.

![Subscribe](https://github.com/LcodeM/fresh_patch_v2/blob/main/assets/images/subscribe-full-screencapture.png)

Additionally, the anchor button is designed to take users who may have navigated directly to the subscribe form directly back to the information on the homepage for further exploration of the site, or for those who simply want to return to the main page for any additional information.

### Future Features and Improvements to be Implemented

Some future features that would be a good addition to the site would be:

-  A new page, title 'Ask Us', where users can submit their questions about gardening to the Fresh Patch team, who in turn would be able to respond individually via email.
    - Further additions to this could be the application of a 'testimonial' style section with user questions that have been answered by the team.
        - This feature should include the option for users to select whether or not they want their questions to feature on the page, as well as optional anonymity, in accordance with GDPR.
![Ask us wireframe](https://github.com/LcodeM/fresh_patch_v2/blob/main/assets/images/ask-us.html.png)

- 404 page for any broken links, including custom branding.

- Improve page performance scores by reducing 3rd party impact from videos/images used (properly sizing images and using tools to improve impact).

- Add a 'chat' extension for asking questions with auto-generated answers to FAQs.

- Create a custom designed logo for the website for brand awareness.

- Build on section content or create the option to 'read more' in linked articles etc.

## Deployment

### Deploying to Github Pages

Fresh Patch was developed in VS Code and deployed to GitHub pages.

The steps to deploy are:

- Navigate to the GitHub repository, or click [here](https://github.com/LcodeM/fresh_patch_v2).
- Go to the 'Settings' tab and then to Pages on the left-hand side.
- From the Source section, select Branch 'main' from the dropdown menu, and make sure '/(root)' is selected next to it. Then click 'Save'.
- Once complete, you will see a message at the top of the page, and a link to the deployed site will be published (this may take a moment).

You can find the link to the live version [here](https://lcodem.github.io/fresh_patch_v2/).

To create a local copy of this repository, copy and paste (https://github.com/LcodeM/fresh_patch_v2.git) into your IDE workspace, or use "git clone https://github.com/LcodeM/fresh_patch_v2.git" in your terminal.

## Testing
